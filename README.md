# MicroBit-Get-Column-Game

A simple game for the micro:bit written in python. 

This is my first attempt at python and doing anything on the micro:bit. Finding something to do in 5 by 5 pixels was the largest challenge!

In the game you need to get a column of 5 - the game shows you which column and then you press either A or B when the 'moving' pixel is in the correct column. It then moves down a row and you keep going until you have done all 5. 
Each time you do a column of 5 your score increases and it gets a little faster.
Each time you make a mistake on the lower levels you go back up a row if not on the first row and lose some energy.
Each time the pixel makes it off the right hand side of the screen you lose some energy.
When you run out of energy it is game over and your score is displayed.
